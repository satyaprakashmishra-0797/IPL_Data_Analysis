# IPL_Data_Analysis

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) using Python. It extracts key insights from ball-by-ball and match-level data to explore batting, bowling, and team performances across seasons.

Dataset used two CSVs:

ipl_matches.csv: Match-level data (id, season, winner, etc.)

ipl_balls.csv: Ball-by-ball delivery-level data (match_id, batsman_runs, total_runs, etc.)

You can download ball-by-ball data from Kaggle.
